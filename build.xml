Now that we have a working buildfile, we could do some enhancements: many times you are referencing the same directories, main-class and jar-name are hardcoded, and while invoking you have to remember the right order of build steps.

The first and second point would be addressed with properties, the third with a special propertyâ€”an attribute of the <project> tag and the fourth problem can be solved using dependencies.
 <project>

    <target name="clean"> 
        <delete dir="build"/>
    </target>

    <target name="compile">
        <mkdir dir="build/classes"/>
        <javac srcdir="src" destdir="build/classes"/>
    </target>

    <target name="jar">
        <mkdir dir="build/jar"/>
        <jar destfile="build/jar/HelloWorld.jar" basedir="build/classes">
            <manifest>
                <attribute name="Main-Class" value="oata.HelloWorld"/>
            </manifest>
        </jar>
    </target>
    <target name="run">
        <java jar="build/jar/HelloWorld.jar" fork="true"/>
    </target>

</project>
